Transfer

making transaction files

transac file

this is php file, accessed from inside html file through Javascript.

$.post("transac.php",
	{
	reciever : reciever,
	amount : amount,
	tx : tx,
	pky : pkey
	}

tx is transaction hash, it's not the hash actually. The php file is responsible for hashing.

It returns results, whether if the transaction is successful or not, so display it in ajax.
